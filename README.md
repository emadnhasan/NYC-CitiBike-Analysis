# Summary
A bike sharing program like CitiBike could be effective in any community. It offers a fun and efficient way to both travel and sightsee. But looking at different metrics many factors can be looked at when trying to implement this program in a new city. The riders are predominantly male, and subscriptions make up a bulk of the business. The busiest times are early morning and early evening, suggesting that many of the riders may use the program for their work commute. 

Additional visualizations can be run in order to provide more input for this program
* An examination of the most popular starting spots may provide more insight as to why women do not use the service as much as men.
* Weather could have a large impact on usage of the program. An analysis of usage in different weather conditions/time of year could offer clarity when implementing the program
* Although the bikeshare is used as a method of work commute, it is also a popular service for tourists who would like to travel the city. This data set is for the New York area, which has many very popular destinations. If this program were to be expanded to a different city, an analysis of popular sights and tourist attractions will be beneficial when selecting start/end locations.
